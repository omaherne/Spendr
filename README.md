## Spendr
Spendr is a personal finance tracking app that allows you to see your daily/weekly/monthly/yearly breakdown as well as choose a budgeting plan to stay on top of your impulse pruchases. This is currently a prototype of the final Spendr system.

To use Spendr, first download all the files. You can then either open it in VSCode (or other IDE) or you can use the terminal. To run this program, compile it using javac and then run the compiled class file using java.
 For example:
 1. Open Terminal.
 2. Navigate to the directory where this file is located.
 3. Compile the file using the following command:
    javac SpendrDemo.java
 4. Run the compiled program using the following command:
    java SpendrDemo

The features are windows that are stacked on top of each other. To see all the features, move the windows. The deployment diagram, product backlog, and scrum writeup are in the filed titled: Team Project - Final/SCRUM (Owen, Rohan, Kiwi, Philemon).
